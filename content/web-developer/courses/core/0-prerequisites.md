#Prerequisites

## Get a unix-based operating system

Either Linux (Ubuntu) or a Mac.

Why? - This is an opinionated choice. Most server side software runs on Linux, the command line is a lot better than Window's command line (IMO). 

### Installing Ubuntu inside a VM (Easy).

* [Download Ubuntu (64bit)](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) (latest LTS version) 
* [Download Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install it.
* Setup Ubuntu inside Virtual Box. [Here's a guide if you need it](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox)

### Installing Ubuntu alongside Windows.

You're on your own. Disclaimer - you might break your Windows.

### Mac

Own a Mac.
